## set up

## 0. libraries and functions
functions_to_read <- list.files("R/functions")

lapply(
  paste0("R/functions/", functions_to_read),
  FUN = source
)


## 1. create folders we need that we don't have

check_and_create_dir("data")
check_and_create_dir("data/raw")
check_and_create_dir("data/intermediate")
check_and_create_dir("data/processed")


## 2. downloading data in folders created above
## a few instances where we can't download data directly from the london datastore into a script, meaning we have a save it in a local folder and read it in from that folder. Doing all of them here, because they take a while and we only need to do it once. 
## basically, it's when files are up there in rds format. For some reason can no longer read them in directly. 
## maybe londondatar2 will fix this when it's working

## also, using the function to download the myes here. Would rather get rid of that though eventually.
